# MCP Gateway

![Hugging Face Token Masking Example](docs/MCP_Flow.png)

MCP Gateway is an advanced intermediary solution for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that centralizes and enhances your AI infrastructure.

MCP Gateway acts as an intermediary between LLMs and other MCP servers. It:

1. Reads server configurations from a `mcp.json` file located in your root directory.
2. Manages the lifecycle of configured MCP servers.
3. Intercepts requests and responses to sanitize sensitive information.
4. Provides a unified interface for discovering and interacting with all proxied MCPs.

## Installation
Install the mcp-gateway package:
```bash
pip install mcp-gateway
```

> `--mcp-json-path` - must lead to your [mcp.json](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations) or [claude_desktop_config.json](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop)

> `--enable-guardrails` - you can use this to activate multiple guardrail plugins

Cursor example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "mcp-gateway": {
          "command": "mcp-gateway",
          "args": [
              "--mcp-json-path",
              "~/.cursor/mcp.json",
              "--enable-guardrails",
              "basic"
          ],
          "servers": {
              "filesystem": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": [
                      "-y",
                      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                      "."
                  ]
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
```

This example gives you the basic and presidio guardrails for token and PII masking for filesystem MCP.
You can add more MCPs that will be under the Gateway by putting the MCP server configuration under the "servers" key.

## Quickstart

### Masking Sensitive Information

MCP Gateway will automatically mask the sensitive token in the response, preventing exposure of credentials while still providing the needed functionality.

1. Create a file with sensitive information:
   ```bash
   echo 'HF_TOKEN = "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"' > tokens.txt
   ```

2. When an agent requests to read this file through MCP Gateway:   
    - Recommend to test with sonnet 3.7
   ```
   Use your mcp-gateway tools to read the ${pwd}/tokens.txt and return the HF_TOKEN
   ```
   
**Output:**

## Usage

Start the MCP Gateway server with python_env config on this repository root:

```bash
mcp-gateway --enable-guardrails basic --enable-guardrails presidio
```

You can also debug the server using:
```bash
LOGLEVEL=DEBUG mcp-gateway --mcp-json-path ~/.cursor/mcp.json --enable-guardrails basic --enable-guardrails presidio
```

## Tools

Here are the tools the MCP is using to create a proxy to the other MCP servers

- **`get_metadata`** - Provides information about all available proxied MCPs to help LLMs choose appropriate tools and resources
- **`run_tool`** - Executes capabilities from any proxied MCP after sanitizing the request and response

## Guardrails
MCP Gateway supports various plugins to enhance security and functionality. Here's a summary of the built-in guardrail plugins:


| Name | PII Masking                                                              | Token/Secret Masking                                                                 | Custom Policy | Prompt Injection | Harmful Content |

#### Prerequisites
- **Obtain a Lasso API key** by signing up at [Lasso Security](https://www.lasso.security/).

To use Lasso Security's advanced AI safety guardrails, update your `mcp.json` configuration as follows:

1. Add the `LASSO_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>` to your environment variable or in the "env" section.
2. Insert other MCP servers configuration under key `servers`

Example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
      "mcp-gateway": {
          "command": "mcp-gateway",
          "args": [
              "--mcp-json-path",
              "~/.cursor/mcp.json",
              "--enable-guardrails",
              "lasso"
          ],
          "env": {
              "LASSO_API_KEY": "<lasso_token>"
          },
          "servers": {
              "filesystem": {
                  "command": "npx",
                  "args": [
                      "-y",
                      "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
                      "."
                  ]
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
```

## How It Works
Your agent interacts directly with our MCP Gateway, which functions as a central router and management system. Each underlying MCP is individually wrapped and managed.

Key Features

**Agnostic Guardrails**
* Applies configurable security filters to both requests and responses.
* Prevents sensitive data exposure before information reaches your agent.
* Works consistently across all connected MCPs regardless of their native capabilities.

**Unified Visibility**
* Provides comprehensive dashboard for all your MCPs in a single interface.
* Includes intelligent risk assessment with MCP risk scoring.
* Delivers real-time status monitoring and performance metrics.

**Advanced Tracking**
* Maintains detailed logs of all requests and responses for each guardrail.
* Offers cost evaluation tools for MCPs requiring paid tokens.
* Provides usage analytics and pattern identification for optimization.
* Sanitizes sensitive information before forwarding requests to other MCPs.

## Tracing

### Xetrack
[xetrack](https://github.com/xdssio/xetrack) is a lightweight package to track experiments benchmarks, and monitor stractured data using duckdb and sqlite.
It will create and maintian a database with each tool_call for you to explore with duckdb, sqlite or pandas using xetrack.
It can also log to logs folder.

```bash
mcp-gateway --enable-tracing xetrack

```
#### Prerequisites
`pip install xetrack`

Example 
```
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "mcp-gateway": {
            "command": "mcp-gateway",
            "args": [
                "--mcp-json-path",
                "~/development/xdss/mcp-gateway/.cursor/mcp.json",
